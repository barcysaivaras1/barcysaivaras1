# 👋 Hi, I’m Aivaras Barcys

I’m a Computer Science Graduate at Queen Mary University of London, having achieved a First Class Honours. My work blends strong academic foundations with practical, team-driven software development experience — from neural networks and compilers to full-stack applications and game AI research.
## Technical Highlights

o    Languages & Tools: Java, Python, JavaScript, React, C#, Spring Boot, MIPS, SQL, Linux

o    Practices: Test-Driven Development (TDD), Object-Oriented Design, Design Patterns, UML software design

o    AI & Research: Trained neural networks (PyTorch), simulated heuristic-based AI gameplay, and researched AI-human alignment in game mechanics

## Selected Projects

o    Expense Tracker (React + Python) – Led a 7-person team to build a full-stack expense app, awarded Top Software Engineering Project by FDM Group.

o    CIFAR-10 Classifier – Built a PyTorch neural network achieving 87% accuracy on image classification.

o    Custom Compiler – Developed a full compiler in Java that translates COOL code into MIPS assembly.

o    Everdell Game AI (Final Year Project) – Digitally implemented a strategic board game and ran over 300 simulations to analyze game balance through AI-human behavior metrics.

o    Blockudoku – Java implementation of a puzzle game using MVC and TDD; achieved 90%+ code coverage and detailed model complexity analysis.
